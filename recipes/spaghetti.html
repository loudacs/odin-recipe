    <h1>Spaghetti</h1>
    <p>After listening to Stanley Tucci lose his mind about this pasta and calling it life-changing and one of the best things he's ever eaten, 
    I decided I'd give it a try. The results were amazing and the key to getting the toasted sweet taste of the zucchini was deep-frying it!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart sunflower oil, or as needed</li>
        <li>6 medium green zucchini</li>
        <li>4 ounces spaghetti</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>2 basil leaves, torn into small pieces</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons grated Pecorino Romano cheese</li>
        <li>3 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese</li>
    </ul>
